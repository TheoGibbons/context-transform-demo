# Canvas Transform Live Demo

An interactive **Canvas Transform Live Demo** showcasing matrix transformations using JavaScript. This tool allows users to experiment with matrix transformations on a canvas, providing a visual and interactive way to understand how transformations like scaling, skewing, and translating work.

## Features

- Interactive sliders and inputs to adjust transformation matrix parameters (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`).
- Real-time updates to the canvas based on transformation values.
- Dragable functionality for dots to dynamically update transformation calculations.
- Randomize dots to test transformations with different configurations.
- Visual representation of the transformation matrix and its effect on the canvas.
- The actual calculation happens in this file: [calc-transform-matrix.js](src/calc-transform-matrix.js)

## Demo

1. Open the [index2.html](https://theogibbons.github.io/context-transform-demo/index2.html) file in your browser. The interface is user-friendly and provides instant feedback.
2. There is also a simple demo [index.html](https://theogibbons.github.io/context-transform-demo/index.html) that showcases the different parameters in the context.transform() function.
